                    <p>
                        It has been proven in studies that students who engage in astronomy during primary or secondary school  
                        are more likely to pursue careers, professions, or jobs in science and technology, and to keep up to date with scientific discoveries. 
                        This does not just benefit the field of astronomy, but reaches across other scientific disciplines as well.

                <h2>Astronomy in Uniting</h2>
                <p>
                    Astronomy is a collaborative effort. During 1887, astronomers from around the world put together their telescope images 
                    to create the first map of the entire sky. Today, astronomers travel around the globe to attend conferences, and 
                    learn from one another.
